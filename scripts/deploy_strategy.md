# Alternative Deployment Strategy

Since we're having dependency conflicts locally, let's use a different approach:

## Strategy: Deploy with Population Script

Instead of uploading locally, we'll:

1. **Modify the API** to populate Pinecone on first startup
2. **Deploy to Render** with Pinecone integration
3. **Let Render** handle the embedding and upload
4. **Switch to Pinecone-only** mode after population

## Benefits:
- ✅ Clean environment on Render
- ✅ No local dependency issues  
- ✅ Automatic population on deploy
- ✅ Memory efficient after population

## Next Steps:
1. Modify main.py to detect empty Pinecone index
2. If empty, populate it once with Bible verses
3. Switch to Pinecone-only search mode
4. Deploy to Render

This approach will work around the local dependency issues and get you deployed faster!
